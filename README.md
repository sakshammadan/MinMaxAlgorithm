# MinMaxAlgorithm
## DAA Assignment

<dd>This repository contains the code for MinMax Algorithm consisting of :</dd>
<li>Python src code using inbuilt stack</li> 
 <br/>
The Max-Min Problem in algorithm analysis is finding the maximum and minimum value in an array.

### There are two methods to implement MinMax Algorithm: 
### <li> Naive Method :</li>
    In this method, the minimum and maximum can be calculated separately by using iterative approach,i.e.loops.
### <li> Recursive Method :</li>
    In this approach, the array is divided into two halves. Then using recursive approach maximum and minimum numbers in each halves are found. Later, return the maximum of two maxima of each half and the minimum of two minima of each half.
